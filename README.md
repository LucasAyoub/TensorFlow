# TensorFlow

## TensorFlow and Computational Graphs:

* Mathematically, a tensor is an N-dimensional vector, meaning that a tensor can be used to represent N-dimensional data sets.
* A Graph is a mathematical model that represents relationships between objects. A graph G = (V, E) consists of a set of vertices V (also called nodes), connected by a set of edges or edges E.
* To create a computational graph, we do each of these operations on nodes, along with the input variables. When the value of a node is input to another node, an arrow goes from one to another and in this case we have a directed graph.
* Therefore, The main objective of a TensorFlow program is to express a numerical computation as a directed graph
